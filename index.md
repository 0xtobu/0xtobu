## About Me

My name is Tobias but often go under the handle “Tobu”, I am currently a penetration tester these days and have been doing that for a solid amount of time now. Prior to doing penetration testing, I was working as a network security consultant. On my free time, I help non-profit organizations such as LAN parties by designing infrastructure that will keep running during intense gaming sessions.
